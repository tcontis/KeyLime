# KeyLime
A command-line based to-do list application

This CLI-based to-do list software is meant for...well...me! However, others may enjoy its direct style of task input and manipulation.

I have tried many other to-do list applications, but they all have shortcomings for me, including:
- Too many clicks required for inputting tasks, changing tasks, etc...
- Limited view customizability
- Long wait times for features
- Dependence on web servers
- Inconsistent natural-language processing
- Features paywalled behind a subscription, such as labels or different views

My philosophy is simple: a to-do list is a database of tasks with various properties. 

From this starting point, there are basic manipulations which then combine to form complex manipulations. All of this is reflected in the codebase and CLI of this software.

### Why The Name?
I like this philosophy so much, that I named this application after a 'key' component of one of my favorite desserts: key lime pie. I absolutely adore citruses.

Also, it's a horrible pun on CLI.
